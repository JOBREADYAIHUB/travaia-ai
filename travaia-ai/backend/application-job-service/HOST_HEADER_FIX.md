# Host Header Issue Fix - TRAVAIA Application Job Service

## ‚ùå Problem Identified
The service is deployed but returning "Invalid host header" error because the TrustedHostMiddleware is blocking requests from the Cloud Run domain.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled TrustedHostMiddleware
Updated `main.py` to comment out the TrustedHostMiddleware that was causing the host header rejection:

```python
# Trusted Host Middleware - Allow all hosts for Cloud Run
# In production, this should be more restrictive, but for now allow all to fix host header issue
# app.add_middleware(
#     TrustedHostMiddleware,
#     allowed_hosts=["*"]  # Allow all hosts temporarily
# )
```

### 2. Manual Deployment Command
Since automated deployment is having issues, use this manual command:

```bash
cd c:\dev\TRAVAIA\travaia-mono-repo\backend\application-job-service

gcloud run deploy travaia-application-job-service \
  --source=. \
  --platform=managed \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port=8080 \
  --memory=1Gi \
  --cpu=1 \
  --project=travaia-e1310
```

### 3. Expected Service URL
After deployment, the service should be accessible at:
- `https://travaia-application-job-service-travaia-e1310.a.run.app`

### 4. Test Commands
Once deployed, test with:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://travaia-application-job-service-travaia-e1310.a.run.app/health

# Root endpoint
curl https://travaia-application-job-service-travaia-e1310.a.run.app/

# Test authentication (should return 401)
curl https://travaia-application-job-service-travaia-e1310.a.run.app/api/applications
```

## üîí Security Note
The TrustedHostMiddleware has been temporarily disabled to resolve the host header issue. In a production environment, you should:

1. Re-enable TrustedHostMiddleware with proper allowed hosts:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    TrustedHostMiddleware,
    allowed_hosts=[
        "*.run.app",
        "travaia-application-job-service-travaia-e1310.a.run.app",
        "travaia.co",
        "*.travaia.co"
    ]
)
```

2. Or use environment-based configuration to handle different deployment environments.

## üìã Next Steps
1. Run the manual deployment command above
2. Test the endpoints to confirm they're working
3. Validate JWT authentication is functioning
4. Re-enable TrustedHostMiddleware with correct host patterns if needed
